"""
HumanVerifier tier contract.

The `score_floor` tier exists and must keep existing: it fires when neither
uniface nor MediaPipe found anything, which happens for genuinely real people —
small distant crops and back-facing walkers. A verified 41x93 crop of a woman
crossing the yard scored 0.85 with 0 pose keypoints and no face, and was only
retained because this tier accepted it on YOLO confidence.

So this tier cannot be the precision control. Neither YOLO score nor bbox
aspect ratio separates real people from ghosts in this data (their score
distributions are near-identical), which is why the frame_pipeline persistence
gate — a track must survive N hits — is what rejects false positives.

These tests pin the contract that keeps real people from being thrown away, and
the one hard guarantee the verifier can still make on its own.
