# SentryVision v1.6.0 — Resource Optimizations

**Release date**: June 2026

This release fundamentally re-architects the SentryVision stack for low-resource hardware (2GB RAM / 2-core CPU), fixes the Python RTSP camera connectivity pipeline end-to-end, upgrades the detection model to YOLOv8n, and adds a one-click install script.

---

## Breaking Changes

- **Frontend no longer runs as a separate container.** The frontend is now compiled at build time and served as static files by the backend. Docker Compose drops from 5 to 4 services. If you were running the frontend standalone in development, use `npm run dev` from `frontend/` for HMR (`:5173`), or let the backend serve it (`:9753`).
- **Redis is disabled by default.** The in-memory cache replaces Redis entirely unless `REDIS_DISABLED=false` is set. This saves ~150MB RAM on low-end hardware.
- **YOLOv4-tiny replaced with YOLOv8n.** The ONNX model is baked into the Docker image. Existing weights in `opencv-service/models/` will be ignored in favor of the built-in model.

## New Features

### One-Click Install (`scripts/install.sh`)
- Zero-interaction install: detects LAN IP, generates secure secrets (`openssl rand`), writes `.env`, creates empty camera configs, builds and starts everything.
- `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anomalyco/home-security-non-docker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash`
- Cameras are added later through the web UI — no terminal editing required.
- Re-runnable: running again detects the existing install and rebuilds if needed.

### go2rtc Integration
- go2rtc (`alexxit/go2rtc:1.9.14`) proxies at `/go2rtc` via `http-proxy-middleware` in Express.
- Manual WebSocket upgrade handler (not `proxy.ws:true`) to avoid intercepting Socket.io paths.
- WebRTC candidates auto-populated (LAN IP + optional public IP via entrypoint script).
- Single RTSP connection to cameras — Python FFmpegReader consumes go2rtc's internal re-stream instead of connecting to cameras directly.

### Class-Whitelisted YOLOv8n Detection
- YOLOv8n ONNX (~215ms inference, 2× faster than YOLOv5n at higher mAP).
- Class whitelist (`_relevant_classes`) restricts to: `person`, `car`, `truck`, `bus`, `motorcycle`, `bicycle`, `dog`, `cat`, `bird`, `horse`. Blocks COCO false positives (`train`, `surfboard`, `vase`, `potted plant`).
- Tuned confidence thresholds: person 0.30, car 0.35, default 0.50.

### Stream Fallback Chain
- **WebRTC** (lowest latency, LAN only — UDP via port 8555).
- **MSE** (fMP4 via WebSocket — works through Cloudflare Tunnel TCP-only).
- **Canvas** (last resort — JPEG frames from Python pipeline).
- Watchdog fallback for stuck `'connecting'` state.

## Bug Fixes

### Python RTSP Pipeline (Root Cause of Zero Frames)
- **Camera RTSP connection limit**: TP-LINK cameras reject a 2nd concurrent RTSP connection with `Operation not permitted`. go2rtc now holds the sole allowed slot; Python reads from `rtsp://go2rtc:8554/{camera_id}` instead of hitting cameras directly.
- **Collapsed dual FFmpeg readers to single reader per camera**: Both previously connected to the same go2rtc stream, wasting one FFmpeg + one RTSP connection per camera.
- **Removed VAAPI hwaccel flags** (`-hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_device /dev/dri/renderD128`) from `ffmpeg_reader.py` — no longer needed (and was crashing on non-Intel hosts).
- **Fixed YOLOv8 ONNX output parsing**: Transposes `(84,8400)` → `(8400,84)` and uses unified pixel-space bbox scaling (640×640 blob, not normalized).

### Backend API Fixes
- **Fixed 6 hanging detection endpoints**: `authenticate` → `requireUser` middleware mismatch in `detectionRoutes.ts` and `detectionRedoRoutes.ts`.
- **Fixed CSP for WebSocket/MediaSource/workers**: Relaxed helmet Content-Security-Policy to allow `ws:` connections and Web Workers.
- **Immutable cache headers**: Added `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for content-hashed static assets.
- **Fixed MSE settle race condition**: `video.srcObject = ms` → `video.src = URL.createObjectURL(ms)`.

### Frontend
- **Stream reconnection stability**: Rewritten `CameraStream.tsx` with robust fallback chain, proper lifecycle cleanup, and watchdog timer.
- **Grid layout fix**: Fixed height calculation so the camera grid doesn't overflow.

## Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before (1.5.0) | After (1.6.0) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Containers | 5 (frontend + backend + opencv + postgres + redis) | 4 (backend + opencv + postgres + go2rtc) |
| RAM idle | ~2.1 GB | ~700 MB |
| RAM full pipeline | ~3.5 GB | ~1.5 GB |
| YOLO inference | ~400ms (YOLOv5n) | ~215ms (YOLOv8n) |
| RTSP connections per camera | 2 (FFmpeg × 2) | 1 (go2rtc → multiple consumers) |

## Infrastructure Changes

- **Docker Compose reduced from 5 to 4 services**: Removed `frontend` and `redis` services; added `go2rtc`.
- **Resource limits tuned**: PostgreSQL 256M/0.5 CPU, Backend 512M/1 CPU, OpenCV 2G/2 CPU, go2rtc 128M/0.5 CPU.
- **PostgreSQL tuned for low memory**: `shared_buffers=64MB`, `max_connections=20`, `work_mem=4MB`, `huge_pages=off`.
- **OpenCV image rebuilt**: Python dependencies streamlined, YOLOv8n ONNX baked into image (no runtime download).

## Upgrade Guide

### From v1.5.0

```bash
git pull
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Post-upgrade steps:**
1. Remove old `redis` service if you had one in your compose override.
2. If you had YOLO weights in `opencv-service/models/`, they are replaced by the baked-in model.
3. Update `go2rtc.yaml` if you were running go2rtc separately — the new config uses port 8555 for WebRTC.

### Fresh Install

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

Or the one-liner:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anomalyco/home-security-non-docker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
